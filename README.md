# Extract Audio Tags

Extract audio tags embedded in a web page with this bookmarklet.

## Installation

Visit [anoved.github.io/ExtractAudioTags](https://anoved.github.io/ExtractAudioTags/) and drag the **Extract Audio Tags** link to your bookmarks bar to install.

## Usage

Visit a web page containing embedded [`audio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio). Click the **Extract Audio Tags** bookmarklet. Each audio [`src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio#attr-src) file will be opened.

**Note:** Behavior may vary depending on your browser or browser settings. In some cases, the audio files may open in a new tab or window. In other cases, the audio files may be downloaded directly. If the page contains more than one audio file, the bookmarklet attempts to open all of them. Some browsers may block this action or only allow one to be opened. If this happens, check your pop-up blocker settings or see if you can follows links to access separate pages for each audio sample.
